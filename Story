1. WHO KILLED PITTY-PAT?
OUTLINE
Mr Boddy's beloved pet parrot was found dead in the conservatory, discovered by Mrs White.

Mrs White: "The window was closed, My Boddy. I guess poor Pitty-Pat flew in to the window and ... and now he's, he's - dead!"

AT THE FUNERAL
Mrs. Peacock: "There, there. Pitty-Pat's just flown to the great birdcage in the sky."
Colonel Mustard: "Mr Boddy, a gentleman must always be  brave!"
Mr Green: "Well I guess the funeral's over"
Professor Plum: "Poor birdie"
Miss Scarlet: "Oh, now, don't pretend you liked Pitty-Pat. None of us did. Why, Mr Green, you once tried to strangle the bird."
Mr Green: "It pecked my ear! And what are you suggesting, anyway? If you're implying anything, I'll beat you to a pulp."
Colonel Mustard: "Threatening a woman? I challenge you to a duel!"
Mrs Peacock: "A duel? In a cemetery? Why that's rude!"
Colonel Mustard: "You're right. Sorry."
Professor Plum: "It's true what you say, Miss Scarlet. I wasn't fond of the little creature. It pooped on my book."
Colonel Mustard: "It stole my anchovies!"
Miss Scarlet: "It ate my red rouge. I never let anyone touch my makeup."
Mrs White: "It tried to nest in my feather duster."
Mrs Peacock: "And it called me a bad word."
Colonel Mustard: "Hmm. So none of us liked the bird. Then we all had a motive for murder. Look at the wound. Someone could have hit Pitty-Pat on the head with a blunt instrument. Then the killer could have placed the parrot beneath the closed window to make it look like an accident."
Mr Green: "Poppycock. Let's bury the thing."
Colonel Mustard: "I've made inquiries. I know that at the time of the 'accident', three of us had blunt weapons. Professor Plum had the Candlestick. You, Mr Green, had the Wrench."
