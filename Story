1. WHO KILLED PITTY-PAT?
OUTLINE
Mr Boddy's beloved pet parrot was found dead in the conservatory, discovered by Mrs White.

Mrs White: "The window was closed, My Boddy. I guess poor Pitty-Pat flew in to the window and ... and now he's, he's - dead!"

AT THE FUNERAL
Mrs. Peacock: "There, there. Pitty-Pat's just flown to the great birdcage in the sky."
Colonel Mustard: "Mr Boddy, a gentleman must always be  brave!"
Mr Green: "Well I guess the funeral's over"
Professor Plum: "Poor birdie"
Miss Scarlet: "Oh, now, don't pretend you liked Pitty-Pat. None of us did. Why, Mr Green, you once tried to strangle the bird."
Mr Green: "It pecked my ear! And what are you suggesting, anyway? If you're implying anything, I'll beat you to a pulp."
Colonel Mustard: "Threatening a woman? I challenge you to a duel!"
Mrs Peacock: "A duel? In a cemetery? Why that's rude!"
Colonel Mustard: "You're right. Sorry."
Professor Plum: "It's true what you say, Miss Scarlet. I wasn't fond of the little creature. It pooped on my book."
Colonel Mustard: "It stole my anchovies!"
Miss Scarlet: "It ate my red rouge. I never let anyone touch my makeup."
Mrs White: "It tried to nest in my feather duster."
Mrs Peacock: "And it called me a bad word."
Colonel Mustard: "Hmm. So none of us liked the bird. Then we all had a motive for murder. Look at the wound. Someone could have hit Pitty-Pat on the head with a blunt instrument. Then the killer could have placed the parrot beneath the closed window to make it look like an accident."
Mr Green: "Poppycock. Let's bury the thing."
Colonel Mustard: "I've made inquiries. I know that at the time of the 'accident', three of us had blunt weapons. Professor Plum had the Candlestick. You, Mr Green, had the Wrench. And Miss Scarlet had the Lead Pipe."
Mr Green: "Nonsense!"
Colonel Mustard: "However, only two of us were in the Conservatory at all today. And one of those two was not Miss Scarlet."
Miss Scarlet: "Thank you for clearing my name."
Colonel Mustard: "Well, there's one final clue. At the time of Pitty-Pat's unfortunate demise, I was in the Billard Room. I was playing snooker with Mr Green and Professor Plum."
Professor Plum: "You were? Oh, yes, quite right, so you were. It slipped my mind. Well, then, I think I know who killed the dirty birdy!"

ANSWER
Miss Scarlet in the Conservatory with the Lead Pipe.
Only three suspects had appropriate weapons - Professor Plum, Mr Green, and Miss Scarlet. Professor Plum and Mr Green were playing snooker at the time of the murder. That leaves only Miss Scarlet. While one of the two suspects in the Conservatory was not Miss Scarlet, the other one was!


2. WHO STOLE MISS SCARLET'S DIAMONDS?
OUTLINE
Miss Scarlet has entrusted her diamonds to the safekeeping of Mr Boddy. Mr Boddy puts the diamonds into his personal safe in the study. However, her diamonds were stolen by one of the suspects and the flow of events are as follow:

Miss Scarlet: "I'll be in the Library when you're done."
--Mr Boddy locked the door of the Study, left the latchkey in the keyhole, just in case anyone tried to peep in. Then he bent over and peered into Mrs White's eyes. They were tightly shut--
--Colonel Mustard heard the locking of the Study door as he was passing by and pressed his ear to the door to listen--
--There was the secret door that led to the secret passageway to the Kitchen. The door was locked. But Professor Plum stood hidden behind it. He had overheard Mr Boddy's entire conversation with Miss Scarlet--
--Mr Green happened to press his face against the Study's window to take a look of what is going on--
--And, of course, Mrs White wasn't really asleep. As soon as Mr Boddy turned his back, she opened her eyes slightly to form narrow slits. She watched as her employer silently turned the dial of the safe--
