<h1 align="center">Death of Mr Basil</h1>
<h2 align="center">Background</h2>
<p>Mr Basil had just told his six favourite guests that he has left a will for all of them. As there is no living heir to the Boddy fortune worth millions of dollars, after Mr Basil dies, the money will be divided evenly among the six guests. However, to the guests dismay, Mr Basil exclaimed that he does not have any intent of dying so soon and plans to live a long long life. The next morning, Mr Basil was found dead in the Library. Follow the series of conversation to determine who is the murderer.
</p>

<h2 alight="center">The Ritual</h2>
<p>Mrs Blank: "This is so horrible, one of you is a murderer!"</p>
<p>Mr Leaf: "I see, and you're innocent?"</p>
<p>Miss Rose: "We all loved him, but we all love money too."</p>
<p>Doctor Melon: "It's true. Any one of us could have done it. We all have the same motive."</p>
<p>Mrs Rainbow: "Were you in the Library last night, Professor?"</p>
<p>Doctor Melon: "Yes. But only to borrow a book on butterfly collecting. Mr Basil was alive and well at the time. I might add, I was there before you, Mrs Rainbow."</p>
<p>Mrs Rainbow: "Well! Mr Leaf was in the Library after me."</p>
<p>Mrs Blank: "And Doctor Melon was in the Library after me."</p>
<p>Miss Rose: "I was in the Library before Mrs Blank."</p>
<p>General Lemon: "I was in the Library before Mr Leaf."</p>
