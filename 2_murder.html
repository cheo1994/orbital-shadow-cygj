    <h1 align="center">The Planned Murder</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
    <p>Five other guests had come up with a ploy to exterminate Mrs Rainbow due to her blamishing column in the daily papers about the rest of the guests. They are gatherd in Mr Leaf's room one night in an attempt to carry out the murder. All of them had masks on and there are five weapons on the table: a Knife, a Wrench, a Revolver, a Lead Pipe, and a Candlestick. Follow the conversation and determine who had which weapon.</p>

    <h2 align="center">In the Kitchen</h2>
    <p>Mr Leaf: "All right, let's get started. Mrs Blank, you take the Revolver."</p>
    <p>Mrs Blank: "Oh, but I don't know how to use it."</p>
    <p>Mr Leaf: "Fine, I'll give you another one."</p>
    <p>--All weapons were handed out--</p>
    <p>--The five guests crept into Mrs Rainbow's room, but the door suddenly opened and all five attackers fell screaming into the dark room. They crashed against the wall. Then the door closed and locked--</p>
    <p>Mrs Rainbow: "Good evening, how nice of you all to drop in."</p>
    <p>--One of the masked figures was back on his feet. He was waving a Lead Pipe--</p>
    <p>Attacker with Candlestick: "That's the trick, Mr Leaf! Get her!"</p>
    <p>--Two attackers rushed at Mrs Rainbow from either side. Mrs Rainbow ducked. The attackers crashed into each other and fell to the floor--</p>
    <p>Attacker #1: "Where did she go?"</p>
    <p>Attacker #2: "I don't see her, Miss Rose..."</p>
    <p>Attacker #3: "Where's the light switch, anyway?"</p>
    <p>These three attackers were holding the Wrench, the Revolver, and the Candlestick.</p>
    <p>--Two more attackers charged forward at the same time at Mrs Rainbow, but she knew one of them was General Lemon, so he must be carrying either the Knife, or the Candlestick--
        <p>--In the darkness, the attackers all crashed into one another head-first and fell in a perfect circle, out cold--</p>
        <p>--Mrs Rainbow crawled out from hiding and flicked on the lights--</p>
        <p>--She bent over the first attacker. The unconscious figure was clutching the Knife. She pulled up the mask--</p>
        <p>Mrs Rainbow: "Doctor Melon. Tsk, tsk. What a bad boy you are!"</p>
