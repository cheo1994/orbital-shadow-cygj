<h1 align="center">The Unfortunate Music Party</h1>
<h2 align="center">Background</h2>
<p>Mr Boddy had organised an afternoon concert with the rest of the guests. After the concert, Mr Boddy's million dollars violin, the Stradivarius was stolen by a mysterious old woman who was on the Second Violin. He did not invite the old woman at all and he noticed something amiss after thinking back about the concert. One of the regular guests was missing from the concert but he couldn't figure out who it was. Just as he was about to demystify the identity of the old woman, he found his invitation list for the day's party.
