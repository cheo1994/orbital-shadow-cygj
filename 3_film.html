  <h1 align="center">Roll of Film</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
  <p>Professor Plum has been spying on Mr Boddy. Mr Boddy was a consultant for a local gumdrop company. These documents detailed Boddy's discovery: a way to make gumdrops that lasted in your mouth for hours! A rival gumdrop company had hired Plum to find out the secret. Professor Plum broke into the Mr Boddy's bedroom drawer and photographed his secret documents. He snapped a whole roll of film. He quickly removed the roll from the camera and slipped it into the right pocket of his purple cardigan sweater. He then went back to the Library to join the rest of the guests.</p>

  <h2 align="center">In the Library</h2>
  <p>Mr Green was performing magic tricks to entertain everyone.</p>
  <p>He leaned over and pulled an egg from behind Professor Plum's ear.</p>
  <p>Everyone laughed and applauded.</p>
  <p>Professor Plum was feeling uncomfortable but Mr Green continued to pat him up and down, searching for a chicken.</p>
  <p>And now he was patting the right pocket of Plum's purple cardigan.</p>
  <p>Mr Green felt the roll of film. The roll of spy film</p>
  <p>Mr Green pulled a chicken out of Professor Plum's right pocket to mask the fact that he had stole the roll of film from Professor Plum.</p>
  <p>Colonel Mustard clapped Mr Green on the back, to commend him of his magic trick.</p>
  <p>However, he wasn't just patting Mr Green to be nice.</p>
  <p>He had seen Mr Green steal the Professor's roll of film and had figured out it must be valuable.</p>
  <p>o now, he slipped his hand into Mr Green's pocket and stole one of the two rolls (One was the secret roll which Plum stole and the other was Mr Green's magic tricks prop).</p>
  <p>He added the roll to his own roll of personal film already in his pocket.</p>
  <p>Professor Plum went up to Colonel Mustard to offer a lighter for his cigarette.</p>
  <p>At the same time, he slapped the Colonel's pockets and secretly took both rools of film from it.</p>
  <p>But Colonel Mustard wasn't the only one who had seen Mr Green steal the film.</p>
  <p>So had Mrs White.</p>
  <p>She removed the other roll of film from Mr Green's pocket while she leaned over him to clear his plate of food.</p>
  <p>Given that Professor Plum's original roll of film has now changed hands exactly twice.</p>
  <p>Does Professor Plum have his own roll of secret film back?</p>
  <p>And if he doesn't, who does?</p>
