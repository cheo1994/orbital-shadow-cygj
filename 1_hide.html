<h1 align="center">Hide & Seek</h1>
<h2 align="center">Background</h2>
<p>The guests are playing a game of Hide-And-Seek in the mansion. The Kitchen was their home base and no one was allowed to hide in there, leaving all other rooms as possible hiding spots. In the midst of their game, a fire broke out and the guests scrambled about to flee the mansion quickly. Mrs Blank was nowhere to be found and the guests only have time to go to ONE of the rooms to find her. They started telling one another the rooms they've checked before leaving the mansion. Which room is Mrs Blank in?
</p>

<h2 alight="center">The Mansion</h2>
<p>Mr Leaf: "I checked the Library. I didn't see Mrs Blank in there!"</p>

<p>Miss Rose: "I checked the Billard Room and the Conservatory. Neither was she in those two rooms."</p>
<p>Mrs Rainbow: "I checked the Hall and the Lounge. She's nowhere to be seen there!"</p>
<p>Doctor Melon: "Uh, I checked either the Dining Room, the Study. or the Conservatory. I can't remember which."</p>
<p>General Lemon: "Seriously Plum! As I was dashing out, I managed to check the Dining Room and she wasn't in there."</p>
<p>As luck would have it, no two rooms were checked twice.</p>
