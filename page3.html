    <h1 align="center">April Fools</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
    <p>It was April Fools' Day, and Mr Boddy had invited his regular six guests over to spend the weekend. As usual, weird things are bound to happen when these people are gathered together in one place. Follow the conversations to see the various gags the guests are up to.</p>

    <h2 align="center">In the Dining Room</h2>
    <p>Mr Boddy: "This is the dessert I have prepared for you this evening... baked Alaska! Now where is it?"</p>
    <p>Mr Green: "You don't mean that silver dish, do you?"</p>
<p>Mr Boddy: "Yes! This is our baked Alaska dessert, Mrs White must have brought it out when I wasn't looking. If I could have everyone's attention. Drumroll please..."</p>
<p>--Mr Green drummed on the table with his hands. Then Mr Boddy pulled off the lid with a flourish. Revealing... Mrs White's head! The head sat on a bed of lettuce. The mouth was wide open, and stuffed with an apple--</p>
<p>--Mr Boddy gasped. Colonel Mustard choked. Professor Plum screamed. Miss Scarlet fainted into Professor Plum's arms. So did Mrs Peacock. The two banged into each other and fell to the floor--</p>
<p>--Mr Green laughed. He reached over and plucked out the apple--</p>
<p>Mr Green & Mrs White: "April Fools!"</p>
<p>--Then, the lights went off. There were screams, and when the lights came back on, Miss Scarlet and Mrs Peacock both fainted again. Professor Plum lay slumped in his chair. He had a knife stuck in his head. He was dead--</p>
<p>--Then he sat straight again--</p>
<p>Professor Plum: "April Fools!"</p>
<p>Mr Boddy: "Oh my, you people are just too good at this. Wow!"</p>
<p>Colonel Mustard: "Don't forget, you eat the dessert with the little spoon."</p>
<p>Miss Scarlet: "The large spoon, you big brute!"</p>
<p>Colonel Mustard: "The little spoon!"</p>
<p>Miss Scarlet: "The big spoon!"</p>
<p>--Soon, they were shouting at each other at the top of their lungs. Then, Miss Scarlet slapped Colonel Mustard with all her might. The Colonel looked stunned. Then he grabbed the Lead Pipe and chased Miss Scarlet around the table in a circle. Miss Scarlet slipped and slid into a corner. Colonel Mustard stood over her with the pipe. His arm came up. It went down fast. There was a dull, horrible thud. Miss Scarlet lay dead at the Colonel's feet. Around her limp body, a pool of dark red blood was slowly spreading--</p>
<p>--Everyone stood in their spot, frozen--</p>
<p>Mr Green: "You're under arrest, Colonel Mustard!"</p>
<p>Colonel Mustard: "What? You dare to touch me? I challenge you to a duel!"</p>
<p>--Colonel Mustard armed with the Lead Pipe, started fighting with Mr Green, who was armed with the Candlestick. Everyone around begged the two men to stop. Colonel Mustard swung the Lead Pipe again and again. Mr Green held the Candlestick with two hands, blocking the blows. Then Colonel Mustard swung one more time, and as he went flying by, Mr Green clonked him on the head with the Candlestick. Colonel Mustard dropped to the floor, motionless--</p>
<p>--Mrs Peacock ran to Colonel Mustard's side. She knelt down and lifted his wrist. She felt for his pulse. When she looked up, she had tears in her eyes--</p>
<p>Mrs Peacock: "He's dead"</p>
<p>--The other guests were shocked at the sight before them--</p>
<p>Colonel Mustard, Mr Green, Mrs Peacock & Miss Scarlet: "Surprise! Happy April Fools!"</p>
<p>--Professor Plum pulled our a Revolver and pointed it to Miss Scarlet--</p>
<p>Professor Plum: "That was some joke. Why would you want to make saps out of us? Don't you know I've killed people for less?"</p>
<p>--Miss Scarlet began to shake--</p>
<p>Professor Plum: "Scared you, didn't I, Miss Scarlet? Now you know what it feels like. April Fools!"</p>
<p>--BANG! The Revolver went off accidentally. Miss Scarlet crumpled to the floor. Around her limp body, a pool of dark red blood was slowly spreading--</p>
<p>--Mr Boddy ran to Miss Scarlet and carried her in his arms. He put his ear right up to Miss Scarlet's red lips, in an attempt to hear her dying words"</p>
<p>Miss Scarlet: "April Fools!"</p>
<p>--Professor Plum and Miss Scarlet were chortling happily--</p>
<p>--Just then, a scream was heard from the Ball Room--</p>
<p>--Mrs White stood frozen in fright--</p>
<p>--Across the room layed Mrs Peacock's motionless body. Her limbs lay at lifeless angles, blood covered her face and clotted her hair. And next to her was the Wrench--</p>
<p>Miss Scarlet: "This is what comes from too much April Fooling. Someone went overboard here"</p>
