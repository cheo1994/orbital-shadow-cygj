    <h1 align="center">The Planned Murder</h1>
    <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
    <p>Five other guests had come up with a ploy to exterminate Mrs Peacock due to her blamishing column in the daily papers about the rest of the guests. They are gatherd in Mr Green's room one night in an attempt to carry out the murder. All of them had masks on and there are five weapons on the table: a Knife, a Wrench, a Revolver, a Lead Pipe, and a Candlestick. Follow the conversation and determine who had which weapon.</p>

    <h2 align="center">In the Kitchen</h2>
    <p>Mr Green: "All right, let's get started. Mrs White, you take the Revolver."</p>
    <p>Mrs White: "Oh, but I don't know how to use it."</p>
    <p>Mr Green: "Fine, I'll give you another one."</p>
    <p>--All weapons were handed out--</p>
    <p>--The five guests crept into Mrs Peacock's room, but the door suddenly opened and all five attackers fell screaming into the dark room. They crashed against the wall. Then the door closed and locked--</p>
    <p>Mrs Peacock: "Good evening, how nice of you all to drop in."</p>
    <p>--One of the masked figures was back on his feet. He was waving a Lead Pipe--</p>
    <p>Attacker with Candlestick: "That's the trick, Mr Green! Get her!"</p>
    <p>--Two attackers rushed at Mrs Peacock from either side. Mrs Peacock ducked. The attackers crashed into each other and fell to the floor--</p>
    <p>Attacker #1: "Where did she go?"</p>
    <p>Attacker #2: "I don't see her, Miss Scarlet..."</p>
    <p>Attacker #3: "Where's the light switch, anyway?"</p>
    <p>These three attackers were holding the Wrench, the Revolver, and the Candlestick.</p>
    <p>--Two more attackers charged forward at the same time at Mrs Peacock, but she knew one of them was Colonel Mustard, so he must be carrying either the Knife, or the Candlestick--
        <p>--In the darkness, the attackers all crashed into one another head-first and fell in a perfect circle, out cold--</p>
        <p>--Mrs Peacock crawled out from hiding and flicked on the lights--</p>
        <p>--She bent over the first attacker. The unconscious figure was clutching the Knife. She pulled up the mask--</p>
        <p>Mrs Peacock: "Professor Plum. Tsk, tsk. What a bad boy you are!"</p>
