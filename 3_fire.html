  <h1 align="center">The Fire</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
  <p>Mr Boddy's mansion was on fire again. One of the three guests, Professor Plum, Miss Scarlet and Mrs Peacock, is the culprit. To solve this mystery, you'll need to determine which statements are true and which statements are false. Mark all of the statements T for True or F for False. The culprit will be the only person who said three lies (i.e three F out of the five statements).</p>

  <h2 align="center">Outside the Mansion</h2>
  <p>#1 "I put the candle out before I went to sleep," said Professor Plum.</p>
  <p>#2 "The fire was out before I went to be bed," said Miss Scarlett.</p>
  <p>#3 "I turned the stove off before the fire started," said Mrs White.</p>
  <p>#4 "Mrs White, your statement is a lie," Professor Plum accused.</p>
  <p>#5 "No, Professor, your first statement is a lie," said Miss Scarlett.</p>
