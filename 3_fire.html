  <h1 align="center">The Fire</h1>
  <h2 align="center">Background</h2>
  <p>Mr Boddy's mansion was on fire again. One of the three guests, Doctor Melon, Miss Rose and Mrs Rainbow, is the culprit. To solve this mystery, you'll need to determine which statements are true and which statements are false. Mark all of the statements T for True or F for False. The culprit will be the only person who said three lies (i.e three F out of the five statements).</p>

  <h2 align="center">Outside the Mansion</h2>
  <p>#1 "I put the candle out before I went to sleep," said Doctor Melon.</p>
  <p>#2 "The fire was out before I went to be bed," said Miss Rose.</p>
  <p>#3 "I turned the stove off before the fire started," said Mrs Blank.</p>
  <p>#4 "Mrs Blank, your statement is a lie," Doctor Melon accused.</p>
  <p>#5 "No, Professor, your first statement is a lie," said Miss Rose.</p>
