<p> It's Mr Green's birthday, the other guests are throwing a party in the Dining Room and have all prepared a gift for Mr Green with the exception of Professor Plum who happened to prepare two gifts for the birthday guy. The crazy thing is that one of the gifts was a time bomb, and absent-minded Professor Plum has forgotten where he left the gift! If you are not able to deduce the room which Professor Plum left the bomb in time, everyone in the mansion dies! </p>
